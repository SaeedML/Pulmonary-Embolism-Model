# Pulmonary-Embolism-Model
Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially lethal disease. When blood clot in the venous vascular system, moves from its original formation site into the lungs, it leads to the blockage of local blood circulation in that part of the lung, eventually cause a systemin syndrome that not only involves the lungs, but also could affect all of the cardiovascular system. Thus, PE is a systemic syndrome, that results in serious cardiovascular outcomes such as right sided heart failure, hemodynamic instability and death.
In this project, I analyzed a database of 1017 patients with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and created 3 models for prediction of serious cardiovascular outcomes. The models were:                                           
1- Logistic Regression model                                                                    
2- Neural Network model                                           
3- Gradient Boosting model                                                    

All of the models were developed based on H2O package in R Studio environment. Finally, the best model for prediction of serious cardiovascular outcomes was the Gradient Boosting model, with an AUC-ROC of 0.94, accuracy of 0.96 and F1-score of 0.76 .
